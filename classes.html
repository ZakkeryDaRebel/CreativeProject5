                <h3>The Classes</h3>
                <p>The most important decision you'll make. What class you choose 
                    decides what you can do in the game and what strengths or 
                    weaknesses you will have. I'll seperate the classes into 3 
                    different types; the martial, the full spellcaster, or the 
                    half caster. Martials have little to none spellcasting skills, 
                    and specialize in either a melee weapon like a sword or a 
                    ranged weapon like a bow, and usually wear armor. A full 
                    spellcaster specializes in spells, and usually don't wear 
                    armor. On the other hand, a half caster can specialize in 
                    both, meaning they are capable of weilding just about any 
                    weapon the martials can use, and can also cast spells, just 
                    not as powerful of spells, as the full spellcasters. Below 
                    contains the 12 different classes as well as a short
                    description on what they are like. Have fun!</p>

                <h3>Barbarian</h3>
                <h5>Primary Ability: Strength</h5>
                <p>Barbarians are Martials that throw all caution to the wind.
                    With the highest health of any other class, they can favor
                    offense over defense, and even not wear armor too. The 
                    core feature of Barbarians is that they can Rage. When 
                    Raging, they deal more damage, take less damage, and 
                    become stronger.</p>

                <h5>Primary Ability: Charisma</h5>
                <p>Bards are full casters that use music and their instruments
                    to weave their magic. They've got an average amount of 
                    health and seem more like a mix between a full spellcaster 
                    and a half caster, because they have more Martial abilities
                    than some of the other spellcasters. Bards have a huge 
                    range of spells, with a lot of support, control, and 
                    damage, making them one of the most versatile spellcasters.</p>

                <h5>Primary Ability: Wisdom</h5>
                <p>Clerics are full casters that call upon their Diety to have
                    their spells be made manifest. They are stereotyped to be 
                    the party's healer, but that isn't the only thing they can
                    do. They do have a plethora of control and support spells
                    and they have a good amount of damage spells too. If theres
                    one thing to say about Clerics, they're always welcome to
                    any group of adventurers.</p>

                <h5>Primary Ability: Wisdom</h5>
                <p>Druids are full casters that have been granted their magic 
                    through nature or a Diety of nature. Their spell selection
                    is also very varied with control, support, and damage spells.
                    But Druid's special ability is that of being able to Wildshape.
                    This is a cool abilitiy which allows them to turn into just 
                    about any beast, great for stealth and recon missions.</p>

                <h5>Primary Ability: Strength or Dexterity</h5>
                <p>Fighters are Martials, and many people think of them as
                    basic ones at that. But they are just very versatile. They
                    can use any kind of fighting style (two handed weapon, 
                    one handed, with a shield, or ranged) and can attack 
                    multiple times in a round, meaning that fighters can 
                    succeed in just about all forms of fighting (except
                    spellcasting).</p>

                <p>Monks are Martials, but not the kind that uses weapons or 
                    armor. They usually use martial arts to fight their foes.
                    Some advantages they have over other martials is they
                    never have to worry about being disarmed, that they can
                    attack multiple times back to back, and they are very fast.
                    They may not have the highest health for a martial, but 
                    they'll still put up a good fight.</p>

                    armor, and yet have limited healhing abilities and spells
                    from the Diety they worship. The special abilitiy of Paladins
                    is that they can attack with their weapon and use their spells
                    to Smite, causing extra damage, especailly if the enemy is
                    an undead or demon. They also have a lot of support abilities
                    making them very useful.</p>

                    spells to defeat their enemies from afar and give support. 
                    Their spell selection is really good, with nice damage 
                    spells and some wonderful healing and control spells. They 
                    also get their powers from nature and are natural born trackers
                    with their special ability being able to excell in specific

                    deal extra damage if they are hidden or have an ally next to
                    the enemy. And so, Rogues are very stealthy and can deal high
                    amounts of damge if they play smart. They don't have a lot of 
                    health, making them feel like a glass cannon, but they have a 
                    lot of defensive abilities to make up for it.</p>

                their spellcasting abilities, they are either born with them 
                or find they have it from some cosmic force. Because of their 
                innate spellcasting afinity, their Special Abilitiy is 
                Metamagic, where they can shape their spells to be more 
                effective in different ways. With their powerful spell 
                selection of control and damage spells, they make some 
                powerful spellcasters.</p>

                    spellcaster, but that just makes them extra versatile.
                    They also don't have as many spells as others, but they
                    make it up with powerful abilities and their damage and 
                    control spels.</p>
